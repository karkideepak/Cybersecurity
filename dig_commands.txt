DNS Lookup utility

dig @server name type

server
The name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited notation. When the supplied server argument is a hostname, the dig command resolves that name before querying that name server. If no server argument is provided, the dig command consults the /etc/resolv.conf file and queries the name servers listed there. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.

name
The name of the resource record that is to be looked up.

type
Indicates what type of query is required — ANY, A, MX, SIG, and so on. The type argument value can be any valid query type. If no type argument is supplied, the dig command performs a lookup for an A record.
